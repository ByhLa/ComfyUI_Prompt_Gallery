# ComfyUI Prompt Gallery

## What is this?
A custom node that adds a UI element to the sidebar that allows for quick and easy navigation of images to aid in building prompts.

## Features
- Snazzy sidebar menu that holds images and metadata for prompt building
- Built in support for all of [Navimixu's Wildcard Files](https://civitai.com/models/615967/ponyxl-wildcards-vault)
  - If you get all these you've got access to ~750 goodies!
- Easily add your own images to the Custom category
- Search and Sort functions
- Automatic metadata extraction for prompt tags (only works with default ComfyUI nodes ATM)
- Drag and drop images with embedded workflows to load it on the canvas (similar to how the new queue works)

## Installation
- `git clone` this repo into your ComfyUI custom nodes folder
  - There are other ways to do this since it's just a js file but if I ever do add nodes better safe than sorry. The repo is tiny enough you can just download it and stick it in there, I won't tell.
- Download any or all (or none if you're gonna be like that) of [Navimixu's archives](https://civitai.com/models/615967/ponyxl-wildcards-vault) and extract them into the `promptImages` folder (located inside this custom node directory). If you do it right your folder should look like this with all the images in various subfolders under `thumbnails`
- NOTE - If you were a SUPER EARLY adopter of this then you need to move the contents of the promptImages folder in INPUT to the folder within the custom node. Once done you can nuke the old folder (yay)

## Requirements
- ComfyUI 0.1.3+
- There's no real requirements here since it's just a js file, enjoy!

## Usage
- Click on any image in the gallery to copy its prompt tags to the clipboard to paste into your workflow.
- Add some images to the sidebar yourself via the Custom category.
- You can also drag and drop images with embedded workflows onto the canvas to load their workflow.
- With some editing can support other YAML files, if you're cool like that.
- If you use Pony in particular the Art Style category makes it super easy to see what various tags can do!

## Limitations
- Uses local storage for setting and metadata, not terrible but a bummer if you change browsers or computers.
- Doesn't do well getting metadata from complex workflows or prompts in non-core nodes.

## Roadmap
- [x] Learn new FE
- [x] Move promptImages out of Input - thanks ltdrdata!
- [ ] Exposing plugin options via settings
- [ ] Implement on-disk storage for metadata (move away from local storage)
- [ ] Easier support for additional "wildcard" packages
- [ ] Prompt stacking? (build a prompt by clicking on various pictures)
- [ ] Better prompt handling and QoL enhancements
- [ ] Some actual "wildcard" style features
- [ ] Whatever bugs you find / features you submit

## Why

I got excited by the new front end and wanted to do something solely based in that if I could. It was also fun to just work in FE for a bit. If you're looking for a simple example of something that leverages the new sidebar, toasts, and the new png metadata scraper, this could be just what you're after!

I aslo thought it would be cool to let people play with something that's not LoRA based. Many checkpoints now have a lot of built in knowledge at this point, and whenever you don't need a Lora, the better in my book!
